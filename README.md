# sudhanshuExpenseTracker
This is my python project which function is tracking our expenses. Basically this project helps to track our expense and manage all the expense at one platform.Create a console-based Expense Tracker
program in Python that allows the user to record daily expenses and view summaries like total spending.

# Project Details / Description:
You are required to build a simple personal finance management tool.
The program should allow the user to:
● Add an expense with details like date, category, description, and amount.
● View all recorded expenses in a clean format.
● Calculate total spending so far.
● Exit the program gracefully when the user chooses to.

All tasks must be implemented using loops, if-else, lists, and dictionaries
only. No user-defined functions or file handling should be used.
